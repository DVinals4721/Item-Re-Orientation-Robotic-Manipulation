# Multi-Arm Robotic System for Large Object Orientation Control

A novel gait-inspired control framework for reorienting very large objects using coordinated multi-arm robotic systems with suction-based end effectors.

## Overview

This repository implements a breakthrough approach to manipulating objects that are significantly larger than the workspace of individual robotic arms. By coordinating multiple UR5e robotic arms in a walking-like pattern, our system can reorient objects up to 5Ã—5Ã—1 meters - approximately five times larger than what any single robot could handle alone.

### Key Features

- **Gait-Inspired Control**: Alternates between "stepping" phases (individual robot repositioning) and "dragging" phases (coordinated object reorientation)
- **Large Object Capability**: Successfully manipulates rectangular objects up to 100Â° in roll and pitch orientations
- **Multi-Arm Coordination**: Coordinates four UR5e robotic arms with suction-based end effectors
- **Workspace Optimization**: Overcomes individual robot workspace limitations through strategic contact point repositioning
- **Surface-Based Manipulation**: Uses discrete surface representation and optimal path planning for stable manipulation

## System Architecture

The system consists of six main components:

### Core Files

- **`gait_generator.py`** - Implements the gait-inspired control algorithm that creates coordinated stepping and shifting patterns for multi-arm manipulation
- **`path_generator.py`** - Handles surface discretization, contact point selection, and A* path planning for optimal robot trajectories on object surfaces
- **`robot.py`** - Defines the robotic arm model and suction-based end effector capabilities
- **`robot_controller.py`** - Manages individual robot control, inverse kinematics, and suction state coordination
- **`simulation.py`** - PyBullet-based physics simulation environment for testing and validation
- **`run.py`** - Main execution script that orchestrates the complete manipulation pipeline

## Technical Approach

### Algorithm Pipeline

1. **Surface Representation**: Discretizes the object surface into a navigable graph structure
2. **Contact Point Selection**: Identifies optimal suction contact points for initial and target orientations
3. **Path Planning**: Uses A* algorithm to find shortest paths between contact points while avoiding edges
4. **Gait Generation**: Creates coordinated step-and-shift sequences that enable large object reorientation
5. **Command Execution**: Translates high-level plans into specific robot position, orientation, and suction commands

### Key Innovations

- **Exponential Orientation Progression**: Prevents collisions by using smaller steps initially and larger steps as clearance increases
- **Hungarian Algorithm Optimization**: Minimizes total robot travel distance through optimal path assignment
- **Arc-Based Transitions**: Ensures smooth robot movements when stepping between surface contact points

## Experimental Results

The system successfully demonstrates:

- âœ… Roll and pitch rotations up to 100 degrees
- âœ… Manipulation of objects up to 5Ã—5Ã—1 meters
- âœ… Stable control throughout reorientation process
- âœ… Coordination of 4 robotic arms in complex patterns

### Current Limitations

- Limited to rectangular prism objects with flat surfaces
- No yaw rotation capability
- Open-loop control (no real-time feedback)
- Kinematic constraints not fully integrated

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyBullet physics engine
- NumPy, SciPy for mathematical operations
- Custom URDF models for inverted UR5e configuration

### Running the Simulation

```bash
python run.py
```

This will execute the complete pipeline from path planning through simulation visualization.
